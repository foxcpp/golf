golf
======

_Go & Obnoxious Lots of Fat_

Small utility to extract information about sections and symbols size from Go
ELF binaries.

Usage
-------

```
golf executable-path
```

golf vs goweight
------------------

goweight measures size of separate object files produced by Go toolchain. golf
analyzes structure of the final executable.

### golf
- Takes linker transformations into account
- Counts C functions as 'unknown' without per-package separation (limitation)
- Debug, file/line and relocation info is not reported in per-package sizes (can be fixed)
- Limited to ELF binary format (can be fixed)
- Doesn't care how you build your code or whether you have sources at all
  Doesn't work with stripped binaries, though.

### goweight
- Uses pre-linker artifacts, ignoring what linker can possibly do with them
- Associates functions from C with Go packages that introduced them
- Debug and file/line info is included intp per-package sizes
- Works with any binary format (e.g. Win32 PE)
- Requires source code
